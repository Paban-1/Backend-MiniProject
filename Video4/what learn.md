# Session cookie ?

-> go to insta login check photos/reels and server forgot you so server ask for login again.

-> server give the user a string ex:("dbadkad") and the string saved to the user browser and when the user send request to the server the string gose with the request ex:("dbadkad") and server identify who you are and don't ask for login again. so what saved in the frontend/browser is called cookie.

and the user connect to the based on the cookie and the connection called session.

so if the cookie is empty or change the server forgot the user.
